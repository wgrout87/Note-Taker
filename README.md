## Description

This repository contains the front and back end code for a note taking application. It was written using JavaScript as the coding language with Express as the web framework for Node.js. The working code can be visited at https://still-cliffs-01909.herokuapp.com/notes. As a note taking application, this project enables the user to create, retrieve, and delete notes from the server database.

## Installation

This project has been deployed to Heroku. Another instance of this application could be similarly installed by cloning the code and performing a git push to heroku from the main branch.

## Usage

To use this application, simply visit the deployed site. The column on the right side of the screen alloys for note entry. Both the note title and note text fields require entry before the save button will appear. Clicking the save button will save the note to the application database, and its title will appear in the left column with a delete button. Clicking on the title will retrieve the note and its text and display it again in a read-only state in the right column. To enter a new note while an old one is being displayed, simply press the plus symbol in the nav bar. At any time a note can be deleted by pressing the delete button that resembles a red trash can.
